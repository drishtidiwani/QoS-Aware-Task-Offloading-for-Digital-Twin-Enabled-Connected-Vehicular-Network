# QoS-Aware-Task-Offloading-for-Digital-Twin-Enabled-Connected-Vehicular-Network
Abstract—Future autonomous driving would require a
plethora of networking resources and high-quality vehicular
communication links. As these mobile devices are resourceconstrained, thus, offloading computer-intensive operations to
the mobile edge servers has been a crucial strategy to meet
the stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements. However,
various types of smart vehicles with distinct capabilities, dynamic
demands, and unpredictable topology pose significant challenges
in realizing efficient edge computing services. To cope with
these challenges, we incorporate a digital twin (DT)-enabled connected vehicular network which can facilitate automated resource
management to enhance QoS of vehicular users. Specifically,
we aim to allocate computation and spectrum resources for a
DT-enabled vehicular network along with designing an optimal
offloading policy. In addition, a problem to optimize the vehicular
network’s utility-cost ratio (UCR) is formulated in order to
reduce the overall latency, energy consumption, and to improve
the throughput. Further, to obtain an optimal resource allocation
framework, we propose a three-step iterative algorithm to optimize the bandwidth, prices for latency, energy consumption, and
offloading factor iteratively until convergence. The simulations
demonstrate that the suggested approach efficiently reduces
the task offloading latency as well as decreases the average
energy usage for vehicular network, in addition to improving the
throughput. Specifically, the utility-to-cost ratio decreases by 85%
and 12.5% for sparse and dense traffic scenarios, respectively for
a vehicle density of 0.137 vehicle/m.
